# 7. Configuring Multi-Container Pod with RWX Access Using PV and PVC

## 7.1 Overview
In Kubernetes, multi-container Pods allow multiple containers to run within the same Pod, sharing the same network namespace and storage volumes. When using shared volumes between containers in a Pod, you can enable ReadWriteMany (RWX) access, which allows the containers to read and write to the same volume concurrently. This is particularly useful when multiple containers need access to the same data, such as in logging or data processing scenarios.

In this tutorial, we will walk through how to configure a multi-container Pod that shares data between containers using a Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) with RWX access.

## 7.2 Concept
A multi-container Pod enables multiple containers to share a single filesystem, network, and storage resources. When working with persistent storage in multi-container Pods, Kubernetes allows the use of volumes with RWX access modes. The RWX access mode allows multiple containers within the same Pod (or across Pods in the case of shared Persistent Volumes) to read and write data to the same volume.

To achieve RWX access, the volume type must support it. Common volume types that support RWX include NFS and CephFS. For this example, we will use an NFS-based PV that supports RWX access.

### Key Concepts:
- **Multi-container Pod**: A Pod with more than one container running together, sharing resources.
- **Persistent Volume (PV)**: A piece of storage that is provisioned by an administrator.
- **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: A request for storage that a Pod uses.
- **RWX Access Mode**: Allows multiple containers to read and write to the same volume.

## 7.3 Benefits
- **Data Sharing**: RWX access enables multiple containers to share the same data, which is ideal for applications like log aggregation, data processing, or caching.
- **Data Consistency**: All containers have access to the same data source, ensuring consistency across containers.
- **Simplified Configuration**: By using Persistent Volumes with RWX access, you avoid managing individual volumes for each container.

## 7.4 Use Cases
- **Logging**: Containers for different microservices can write logs to the same shared volume, making it easier to aggregate logs.
- **Cache Sharing**: Multiple containers need access to the same cache, ensuring that updates made by one container are immediately available to others.
- **Data Synchronization**: Containers running different parts of a distributed system (e.g., data processing containers) need access to shared data.

## 7.5 Real-World Scenario
In a microservices architecture, one container might generate data that needs to be processed by another container in the same Pod. For instance, an `nginx` container might write logs to a shared directory, and a second `log-processor` container reads those logs for analysis. By using a shared Persistent Volume with RWX access, both containers can access the same data concurrently, enabling real-time data processing.

## 7.6 Implementation Example

### 7.6.1 Step 1: Create the NFS-Based Persistent Volume
We will use an NFS-based Persistent Volume (PV) to allow RWX access for the multi-container Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  storageClassName: manual
  nfs:
    path: /srv/nfs/data
    server: <NFS_SERVER_IP>  # Replace with the NFS server IP address
```

### Explanation of the YAML:
- **nfs.path**: The path on the NFS server.
- **nfs.server**: The IP address of the NFS server.
- **accessModes**: `ReadWriteMany` allows multiple containers to write to the same volume.
- **persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy**: `Retain` ensures that the data is not deleted after the PV is released.

### 7.6.2 Step 2: Create the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
Create a PVC to request access to the NFS-based volume.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### Explanation of the YAML:
- **accessModes**: `ReadWriteMany` enables multiple containers to write to the volume.
- **resources.requests.storage**: Requests 1Gi of storage from the PV.

### 7.6.3 Step 3: Create the Multi-Container Pod
Now, create the Pod with two containers that both mount the same volume.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-container-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  - name: log-processor
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo $(date) >> /usr/share/nginx/html/log.txt; sleep 5; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: shared-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: nfs-pvc
```

### Explanation of the YAML:
- **nginx container**: Serves content from the shared volume.
- **log-processor container**: Writes logs to the shared volume every 5 seconds.
- **volumeMounts.mountPath**: Both containers mount the shared volume to the same directory in their file system.

## 7.7 Verification Steps

1. **Create the NFS Persistent Volume**:
   Apply the PV YAML:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nfs-pv.yaml
   ```

2. **Create the PVC**:
   Apply the PVC YAML:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nfs-pvc.yaml
   ```

3. **Create the Multi-Container Pod**:
   Apply the Pod YAML:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f multi-container-pod.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify the PVC is Bound**:
   Check if the PVC is bound to the PV:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pvc nfs-pvc
   ```

   The `STATUS` should be `Bound`.

5. **Verify the Pod is Running**:
   Check the status of the Pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   The Pod `multi-container-pod` should be running.

6. **Verify Shared Data**:
   Enter the `nginx` container and check if the log file is being created:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it multi-container-pod -c nginx -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/log.txt
   ```

   You should see log entries with timestamps being written to the file.

7. **Verify the Nginx Web Page**:
   Ensure the Nginx server is serving the page with the log data:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward pod/multi-container-pod 8080:80
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser, and you should see the data served from the shared volume.
