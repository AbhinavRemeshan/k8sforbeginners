# Kubernetes Troubleshooting Guide

## Section 1: Introduction

Kubernetes, while immensely powerful, can present a variety of challenges during day-to-day operations. From application deployment issues to cluster-level failures, having a structured approach to diagnosing and resolving these problems is essential. This troubleshooting guide aims to assist users in identifying common issues encountered in Kubernetes environments and provides actionable steps to resolve them effectively.

By following this guide, you will gain insights into:
- Diagnosing pod-related issues.
- Investigating cluster health and node failures.
- Resolving networking and service connectivity problems.
- Debugging persistent storage and volume-related errors.
- Troubleshooting authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).

This guide builds upon practical lab exercises to ensure a hands-on understanding of Kubernetes troubleshooting. Use it as a reference for identifying and resolving issues in real-world scenarios. The structure of this document will evolve as we incorporate detailed steps and case studies from provided lab materials.

## Section 2: Troubleshooting Kubernetes Cluster

### Areas to Troubleshoot
- Cluster health and configuration.
- Node statuses and connectivity.
- Namespace-specific issues.

### Possible Scenarios
- The cluster is unresponsive or partially operational.
- Nodes are not in a ready state.
- Namespace-specific issues causing resource unavailability.

### Steps and Commands to Troubleshoot
#### 1. View Nodes in the Cluster
**Command:**
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
This provides an overview of all nodes and their statuses.

#### 2. Fetch Cluster Information
**Command:**
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```
Gives details about the cluster's control plane and components.

#### 3. Obtain a Cluster Dump
**Command:**
```bash
kubectl cluster-info dump
```
Generates diagnostic information about the cluster's state.

#### 4. Explore Dump Command Options
**Command:**
```bash
kubectl cluster-info dump --help
```
Displays available options for generating a cluster dump.

#### 5. Generate Namespace-Specific Dump
**Command:**
```bash
kubectl cluster-info -n <namespace> dump
```
For example, to diagnose issues in the `test` namespace:
```bash
kubectl cluster-info -n test dump
```

#### 6. Check Cluster Component Health
**Command:**
```bash
kubectl get componentstatus
```
Reports the health of cluster components such as etcd, scheduler, and controller-manager.

### Things to Check
- Are all nodes in a `Ready` state?
- Is the control plane accessible using `kubectl cluster-info`?
- Are specific namespaces experiencing issues?
- Are cluster components reporting healthy statuses?

By following these steps, you can effectively diagnose and resolve common Kubernetes cluster issues.
